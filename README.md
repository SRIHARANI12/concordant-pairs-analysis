# Concordant Pairs and Risk Ties Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project implements a Python program to analyze Concordant Pairs, Discordant Pairs, Risk Ties, Ties, and Permissible Pairs from a given dataset.
It is particularly useful for statistical evaluations, such as analyzing relationships between variables in ranking systems or biomedical data comparisons.

The program also generates a **bar chart** to visually represent the analysis results, making interpretation easier and more intuitive.

##  Technologies Used
- **Python** – Core programming language used  
- **Matplotlib** – For visualizing the pair analysis (bar chart output)  

---

##  Features

- Accepts input data (pairs of scores/ranks)
- Automatically calculates:
  -  Concordant Pairs
  -  Discordant Pairs
  -  Risk Ties
  -  Ties
  -  Permissible Pairs
- Prints the calculated values to the terminal (Command Prompt)
- Generates a **bar chart** summarizing the results

## 📊 Sample Input Used in Code

```python
times = [1, 2, 3, 4]
risks = [4, 3, 2, 1]
```

## 📁 Files Included

- `concordant_pairs.py` – Main Python script  
- `output.png` – Bar chart output image  
- `README.md` – Project documentation
